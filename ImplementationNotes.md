## Actions
Launched City Skylines 2, and opened map editor, then went to options -> modding and installed the moddding toolchain.

I went to unity.com and tried to make an account. I'm having to 'verify' with recapta for 20+ times, so I am giving up on that for now.  need a key
Verified my account using chrome

WAs able to finish the modding toolkit installation on CS2 until I got all green checkboxes

the code is written in c sharp. I copied a helloworld app off the tutorial into a `helloworld.cs`. I went to VS Code extensions and downloaded C# Dev Kit v1.9.55
I then opened a terminal and ran `csc helloworld.cs`

I got a road overlay PNG from https://terraining.ateliernonta.com/ for the same area I wanted to build. I installed a mod to have overlays.
